## Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

### Overview:

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering using the Surprise library. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique in recommendation systems, where users are recommended items (in this case, movies) based on their similarities to other users. This system analyzes historical movie ratings from users and predicts new movies to recommend to them.

### Dataset:
The Original dataset is taken from Kaggle Netflix Movie Rating Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitjavia/netflix-movie-rating-dataset

### Features:

- **Data Loading:** The project loads movie and rating data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames, providing a clear overview of the dataset.
  
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes the Surprise library to create a collaborative filtering model. Specifically, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm is employed to make personalized movie recommendations for users.
  
- **Dynamic Recommendations:** Provides dynamic recommendations for any user, allowing you to specify the number of movie recommendations to display.

- **Preventing Redundancy:** Ensures that the recommended movies are unique, avoiding repetitions in the list of suggestions.

### How to Use:

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your movie data in CSV format. Ensure it includes User IDs, Movie IDs, and Ratings.

2. **Implementation:** Integrate the provided code into your Python environment. Adjust the `num_recommendations` variable to set the number of movie recommendations you want to receive.

3. **Run the Code:** Execute the Python script to generate personalized movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Specify the User_ID for whom you want to make recommendations
user_id = 7  # Replace with the User_ID you want to recommend movies for

# Number of recommendations to provide
num_recommendations = 5  # Change this to the desired number of recommendations

# ... (Run the code)

# Output will display unique movie recommendations for the user.
```

### Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Surprise

### Credits:

This project utilizes the Surprise library for collaborative filtering implementations. Special thanks to the open-source community for their contributions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and integrate this movie recommendation system into your projects. Enjoy recommending movies to users with this collaborative filtering approach!
